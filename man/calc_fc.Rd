\title{Calculate Log Fold Changes between Groups
This function calculates log fold changes (LFC) for OTUs between two groups within a phyloseq object.
It supports two normalization methods: TSS (Total Sum Scaling) and CLR (Centered Log-Ratio).}
\usage{
calc_fc(data_1, data_2, norm_method)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_1}{A phyloseq object representing the first group for analysis.}

\item{data_2}{A phyloseq object representing the second group for analysis.}

\item{norm_method}{Character string specifying the normalization method. Choose either "TSS" or "CLR".}
}
\value{
A numeric vector with log fold changes for each OTU between the two groups.
}

# Assuming you have two phyloseq objects for two groups:
# log_fc <- calc_fc(group_1, group_2, "TSS")
